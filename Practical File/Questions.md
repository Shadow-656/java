1. Write a java program to add two integers and two float numbers. When no arguments are supplied, give a default value to calculate the sum. Use function overloading.

2. Write a program to implement constructor overloading by passing different number of parameters of different types.

3. Write a program to perform mathematical operations. Create a class called AddSub with methods to add and subtract. Create another class called MulDiv that extends from AddSub class to use the member data of the super class. MulDiv should have methods to multiply and divide A main function should access the methods and perform the mathematical operations.

4. Write a program with class variable that is available for all instances of a class. Use static variable declaration. Observe the changes that occur in the objectâ€™s member variable values.

5. Write a java program to create a student class with following attributes.: - Enrollment No, Name, Mark of sub1, Mark of sub2, mark of sub3, Total Marks. Total of the three marks must be calculated only when the student passes in all three subjects. The pass mark for each subject is 50. If a candidate fails in any one of the subjects his total mark must be declared as zero. Using this condition write a constructor for this class. Write separate functions for accepting and displaying student details. In the main method create an array of three student objects and display the details.

6. In a college first year class are having the following attributes Name of the class (B.Sc., BBA, M.Sc.), Name of the staff No of the students in the class, Array of students in the class Define a class called first year with above attributes and define a suitable constructor. Also write a method called best student() which process a first year object and return the student with the highest total mark. In the main method define a first-year object and find the best student of this class.

7. Write a java program to create an abstract class named shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area (). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class shape. Each one of the class contains only the method print Area () that print the area of the given shape.

8. WAP that describes a class person. It should have instance variables to record name, age, and salary. Create a person object. Set and display its instance variables.

9. Write a program to swap two values using object reference should have a swap function.

10. Write a program to explain the multithreading with the use of multiplication table. Three threads must be defined. Each one must create one multiplication table.

11. Write a java program in which thread sleep for 5 sec and change the name of thread.

12. Write an application to illustrate Interface Inheritance.

13. Write an application that shows how to create a user-defined exception.

14. Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw NumberFormatException. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an ArithmeticException. Display the exception in a message dialog box.

15. Write a small program to catch Negative Array Size Exception. This exception is caused when the array is initialized to negative values.

16. Write a java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a Grid Layout to arrange Buttons for digits and for the + - * % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divide by zero.

17. Write a program to implement all string operations.

18. Write an applet program that displays a simple message.

19. Write a program to create student report using applet, read the input using text boxes and display the o/p using buttons.

20. Write an Applet displaying line, rectangle, rounded rectangle, filled rectangle, filled rounded rectangle, circle, ellipse, arc, filled arc and polygon, all in different colours.

21. Write a program to implement thread, applets, and graphics by implementing animation of ball moving.

22. Write an Applet that displays a counter in the middle of applet.

23. Write a java program that handles all mouse events and shows the event name at the centre of the window when mouse event is fired(Use Adapter classes).

24. Write a program to implement keyboard events.

25. Write a program to create menu bar and pull-down menus.
