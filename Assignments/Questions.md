1. Write a java code to understand pass by value and passing reference as an objects.

2. Create a class with two functions-one recursive and one non recursive. Either of this function should be capable of calculating the factorial of a number. Create the classes in different package and access the methods through main function.

3. WAP in which you need to consider two integer inputs which must be supplied by the user. You will display the sum of the integers if and only if the sum is less than 100. If it is not less than 100, throw your own exception.

4. Write a java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads.
   •	First thread generates the power of any given number.
   •	Second thread computes the value of the square of the number.
   •	Third thread computes the value of cube of the number.
and after that print the values from all the three threads

8. Write a java program to create an applet which receives an integer value in one text field from the user and calculate the factorial of that number in another text field by pressing the “Calculate” Button.
